# 2732 <--> 2532 adapter

Taken from here: [2532 to 2732 adaptor](http://www.neoncluster.com/aamber_pegasus/Blog/Entries/2010/5/5_2532_to_2732_and_visa_versa_adaptor..html)

This product is intended to allow a 2732 EPROM to be placed into  a 2532 EPROM socket or a 2532 EPROM to  be  placed  into a 2732 EPROM socket.
Fitting I.C. pins for IC1 and a socket for IC2 allows a 2732 to be plugged into a 2532 socket,
whilst fitting I.C. pins for IC2 and a socket for IC1 allows a 2532 to be plugged  into a 2732 socket.

The 2732 has an output enable signal in addition to the chip enable signal.
In most cases, the output enable signal can simply be connected to ground.
However, it may sometimes be desirable to connect the ouput enable signal to the chip enable signal.
Jumpers JP1 and JP2 allow these settings.

* If JP1 is fitted, then the ouput enable will be connected to the chip enable.
* If JP2 is  fitted,  then  the  ouput enable will be connected to  GND.

JP1  and  JP2  should __NEVER__  be fitted at the same time - one  or the other, but not both. In  most cases, fitting JP2 will  suffice.
